# Claude Usage Monitor

A native desktop application built with Tauri that monitors your Claude API usage costs in real-time. Features a system tray integration for quick access to daily spending and detailed usage trends.

## Features

- **Real-time Usage Tracking**: Monitor your Claude API costs with configurable polling intervals (1min, 5min, 10min)
- **System Tray Integration**: Always-visible cost display in your system tray with quick access menu
- **Daily & Weekly Trends**: Visual charts showing usage patterns over the past 7 days
- **Background Monitoring**: Runs quietly in the background, hiding to tray instead of closing

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ with pnpm
- Rust (for development)
- ccusage CLI tool (`bunx ccusage` must be available)
- Valid Claude API credentials configured for ccusage

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd claude-usage
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The built application will be available in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

### First Run

1. Ensure you have the `ccusage` CLI tool installed and configured with your Claude API credentials
2. Launch the application - it will appear in your system tray
3. Click the tray icon to open the main window
4. Configure your preferred polling frequency in the Settings tab

### System Tray

- **Left click**: Toggle main window visibility
- **Right click**: Access context menu with quit option
- **Tray title**: Shows today's current cost (e.g., "$1.23")
- **Tooltip**: Displays today's cost and current mode

### Main Interface

The application features three main tabs:

- **Dashboard**: Today's usage, weekly/monthly totals, and last update time
- **Trends**: 7-day visual chart with usage statistics and daily comparisons
- **Settings**: Configure polling frequency and auto-start preferences

### Data Sources

The application fetches usage data by executing `bunx ccusage --json` directly, ensuring you always get the most up-to-date information from the Claude API.

## Configuration

### Polling Frequencies

- **1 Minute**: Fast updates for active development (red indicator)
- **5 Minutes**: Balanced updates for regular monitoring (orange indicator)
- **10 Minutes**: Slower updates to conserve resources (green indicator)

### Auto-start

Enable auto-start to have the application launch automatically when your system boots.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No usage data available"**

- Ensure `bunx ccusage --json` works in your terminal
- Verify your Claude API credentials are properly configured
- Check that you have an active internet connection

**Window won't close**

- This is by design - the application hides to the system tray instead of closing
- Right-click the system tray icon and select "Quit" to fully exit

**Data showing $0.00**

- This usually indicates ccusage isn't returning valid data
- Try running `bunx ccusage` manually to verify it's working
- Check the application logs for any error messages

## Development

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri v2
- **Data Source**: ccusage CLI tool via direct execution
- **State Management**: Tauri's state management with Rust mutexes

### Key Files

- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: Main Rust backend with API handlers and system tray logic
- `src/App.tsx`: Main React application component
- `src/components/`: React components for dashboard, trends, and settings
- `src/types/index.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for data structures

### Building

The application uses Tauri's standard build process:

```bash
# Development
pnpm tauri dev

# Production build
pnpm tauri build

# Frontend only (for testing)
pnpm dev
```
